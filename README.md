# conj2019

Material presented at my 2019 Clojure/conj talk, "Defeating the Horsemen of the Coding Apocalypse."

## Actual Code Used/Demoed
The "simple system" demo is located in src/main/clj/conj2019/horsemen/core.clj. It can be launched by switching to that ns and invoking `(start sys)`.

The "EBS/Remote REPL" demo is located in src/main/clj/conj2019/full_demo/system.clj. It can launched by switching to that ns and invoking `(partsbin/start sys)`. The main class used when packaging and deploying to EBS is located at src/main/clj/conj2019/full_demo/core.clj.

There are a handful of other files in the project that didn't make it into the demo. Feel free to poke around. src/main/java/conj2019/horsemen/app/v5 contains a Spring Boot version of the simple system app for comparison, but there wasn't time to discuss it in the talk.
